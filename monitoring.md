## Opting in to and enabling {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} metrics
{: #opt_in_metrics}

Before you can start to use {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} metrics, you must first opt in and then enable platform metrics by completing the following steps:

1. Enable platform metrics for {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}. For more information, see [Enabling platform metrics ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-platform_metrics_enabling){:new_window}. The owner of the account has full access to the metrics data. For more information about managing access for other users, see [Getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-getting-started){:new_window}.

2. To navigate from the {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} instance page to the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} dashboard, click the three vertical dots in the upper right corner of the instance page (**Service instance options**) and select **Monitoring**.

   On your first usage, you might see a welcome wizard. To advance to the dashboard selection menu, select **Next** and then **Skip** at the bottom of the **Choosing an installation method** page. Accept the prompts that follow. You can then select the **{{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}** dashboard.

   Dashboards are available only after metrics start to be recorded; this might take a few minutes to initialize.
