## Temporal join and align functions
{: #temporal_join_align_funcitons}

A temporal join produces a single array time series based on the timeticks and values of the two input time series. A temporal align produces two output time series with identical timeticks. In both cases, an interpolator is used to fill in missing values.

The output time series contain the concatenated values of the input time series. For example:

- If the first time series is a DoubleTimeSeries with an observation (t1, a1), and the second time series is a DoubleTimeSeries with an observation (t1, b1), the join will result in (t1, [a1, b1]).
- If the first time series is a DoubleArrayTimeSeries with an observation (t1, a1, a2), and the second time series is a DoubleArrayTimeSeries with an observation (t1, b1, b2, b3), the join will 
result in (t1, [a1, a2, b1, b2, b3]).

**TS_LEFT_ALIGN(*TimeSeries*, *TimeSeries*, InterpolatorType)**  
Output: *TimeSeries*, *TimeSeries*

each of which is aligned with the other. The output time series are of the same type as the input time series.

**TS_RIGHT_ALIGN(*TimeSeries*, *TimeSeries*, InterpolatorType)**  
Output: *TimeSeries*, *TimeSeries*  
Temporally right align two time series of the same type, and set any missing values to null. Unlike TS_RIGHT_JOIN, this produces two output time series,

Output: *TimeSeries*, *TimeSeries*  
Temporally full align two time series of the same type, and set any missing values to null. Unlike TS_FULL_JOIN, this produces two output time series, 
each of which is aligned with the other. The output time series are of the same type as the input time series.

**TS_VECTORN(*TimeSeries*, *TimeSeries*, ...)**  
Output: *ArrayTimeSeries*  
Temporally inner join up to 10 time series of the same type to produce a single array time series of vectors. Only observations with matching timeticks 
are retained, so if all observations are to be retained, align the input time series before using this function.

## Interpolation functions
{: #interpolation_functions}

Use interpolation either to fill missing values or to resample a time series at a different periodicity.

**TS_RESAMPLE(DoubleTimeSeries, Long, InterpolatorType) or TS_RESAMPLE(StringTimeSeries, Long, InterpolatorType)**  
Output: The output is of the same type as the input time series.  
Resample the specified time series using the specified periodicity (second parameter). Note that, depending on the periodicity:

- The output time series might contain new, generated observations that are not in the input time series. The [interpolator](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-artifact#interpolator_creation) (third parameter) determines how to set values for any generated observations.
- Some of the observations in the input time series might be absent from the output time series. However, even skipped observations are used during interpolation.

{: #string_matching_functions}

Match a string time series against a string sequence or a set of strings.

**TS_MATCH(StringTimeSeries, MatcherType, Array[String])**

If the specified pattern (third parameter) matches the values in the input time series (first parameter) as required by the specified matcher (second parameter), 
this function returns the matching observations; otherwise, it returns null.

## Time functions
{: #time_functions}

Convert a string or timestamp into a value of type Long.

**TS_TIMESTAMP(String) or TS_TIMESTAMP(TimestampType)**  
Output: Long  
Convert the specified string or timestamp into a value of type Long containing an epoch millisecond timestamp in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).  
- If the input parameter is a string, it is parsed using the [DateTimeFormatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html).
- If the input parameter is a TimeStampType value, it is treated as a Java timestamp.
