{:dependencies}

## Dependencies to other IBM Cloud Services
{:dependencies_cloud}

In general, customer data is not leaving the region or country, in which an instance of {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} had been provisioned. This excludes customer data used by dependant service instances which are under customer responsibility.

### Critical Dependencies
{:critical}

The following dependencies of {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} are considered critical. 
Any loss of connectivity or service of one of these dependencies results in a functional impact to the customer on {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}.

Service name | Description
--- | ---
Business Support Services for IBM Cloud (BSS) | Used to access information about the IBM Cloud account, service subscription, service usage, and billing.
IBM Analytics Engine (IAE) | Spark engine used to execute the SQL queries. To learn more, see [IBM Analytics Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine).
