# Data layout and modeling
{: #datalayout}

Planning your data model and distribution of your data in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} can lead to increased performance and lower costs. The article [How to lay out Big Data in IBM Cloud Object Storage for Spark SQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout) shares tricks of the trade to impact cost and performance of your SQL queries.

{{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} allows you to specify the format and layout in which a result for an SQL query is written. 
By adding these abilities, {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} opens up serverless data transformation in Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}. For more information, see [SQL Query Releases Serverless Transformation and Partitioning of Data in Open Formats](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/sql-query-releases-serverless-transformation-and-partitioning-of-data-in-open-formats).
