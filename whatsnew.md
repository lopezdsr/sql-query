- {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} JSON parser is processing and extracting all JSON keys in lowercase, so it can work correctly on LogDNA data.
- Storing new objects in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} can trigger {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} executions. It is enabled by the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} [event provider](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/cloud-object-storage-event-provider-enables-hello-serverless-and-more) for {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}. By combining it with the SQL [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmfunctions/sqlquery/), you can automatically run SQL-based post processing for new objects.
- {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} has query hints for SQL queries that have potential for faster execution by using certain features of {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}. These hints are flagged with a light bulb icon in the job list and the specific hint is available inside the Details pane.

## September 2019

- Support for ETL to {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}}: You can specify [Db2 target tables](/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overview#unique) in your SQL queries to process data from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} and save the {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} result into {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}.

## August 2019

  You can directly preview query results in JSON format in the SQL console. Add `INTO <COS URI> STORED AS JSON` to your SQL statement to produce JSON output and preview it in the web console.
- Support for Parquet schema evolution through the [`MERGE SCHEMA`](/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference#externalTableSpec) sub clause for `STORED AS PARQUET` input data. Check out the new samples in the UI.
- Support for [`CLEANCOLS`](/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference#tableTransformer) table transformation function that generically cleanses all input column names from characters that are not supported by the Parquet target format. Check out the new Samples.
- Support for [`FLATTEN`](/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference#tableTransformer) table transformation function that generically flattens all nested input columns into a flat hierarchy, allowing to easily work with, for example, JSON input data and write the results out to flat CSV files. Check out the new samples in the UI.

## June 2019

- {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} is available in Frankfurt, Germany. When you provision new instances, you can select whether it is being provisioned in Dallas or in Frankfurt.
